# flightClub
A flight club is for people who are always travelling across the world. This application uses tequilla API(https://tequila.kiwi.com/portal/docs/tequila_api) to search cheap flights for next six months for some specific locations accross the globe. The club member data is managed in google sheet using Sheety API(https://sheety.co/). The member has to sign up at: https://replit.com/@VaibhavSachdeva/flight-club#main.py

When the code is hosted online it can send email to the club members as soon as it finds a cheap flight deal for them.
